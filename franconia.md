Spacious 2 person flat on Franconia Road (in Clapham).

Has a really nice kitchen and separate living room. The bedroom
available is a good size and has a double bed and wardrobe etc (see
pictures below). The flat also has an outside balcony for
drinks/barbequeues etc in the Summer.

Excellent transport links - Less than 10 mins walk from both Clapham
Common and Clapham South tube stations.

About me: I'm a friendly guy in my mid-20s who likes sport, and
socialising. Would be nice to find someone, male or female, who is
friendly, preferably a similar age to myself.
