title: franconia flat
---

Spacious 2 person flat on Franconia Road (in Clapham).

Has a really nice kitchen and separate living room. The bedroom
available is a really good size, with a double bed and wardrobe etc
(see pictures below).

The flat also has an outside balcony for drinks/barbequeues etc in the
Summer.

Transport links are excellent - less than 10 mins walk from both
Clapham Common and Clapham South tube stations.

About me: I'm a friendly guy in my mid-20s who likes sport, and
socialising. Would be nice to find someone, male or female, who is
friendly, preferably a similar age to myself.

Photos below. They were taken in the evening so looks quite dark
unfortunately, but the flat is normally very bright and has good
natural lighting.
