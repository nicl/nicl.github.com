## <a id="personal-statement"></a>Personal statement

I am a backend software developer from the UK.

I love solving complex problems by pursuing simple, but not
necessarily easy, solutions. I use a range of technologies and enjoy
learning new things.

I like open source.

Besides programming, I am also interested in international development
and economics.

In my free time I read books, play football, and spend time with my
friends.

## <a id="technology-and-skills"></a>Technologies and Skills

If programming languages were spoken then you might say I:

- am fluent in **PHP**, SQL (specifically, having used MySQL, SQLite),
  HTML and CSS
- can get by in **Javascript**
- know a bit of **Scala**, **Clojure**, and **Ruby**
- know a bit of noSQL databases, particularly **MongoDB**

The vast majorit of my professional experience is with PHP. I have
worked with several PHP frameworks and CMSs - most notably
[Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) (and the
[Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) microframework) and
[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org).

But, fundamentally, I consider myself a programmer; my aim is to use
the right language and tools for the job, and I enjoy learning new
technologies and ways of thinking in order to do this.

I use [git](http://github.com/nicl) everyday and also have experience
working with SVN.

I am a **native-English speaker**, but also speak **French** to a
reasonable level.

I studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at
[university](http://www.ox.ac.uk), but decided to program for a living
after making websites for friends and various events as a hobby both
during and after university. I also have a masters from LSE in
Development Studies (International Development - both the political
side, and the economics).
