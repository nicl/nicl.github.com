title: about me
---

I am from the UK but have also lived [abroad][].

I love solving complex problems by pursuing
[simple, but not necessarily easy][simple-made-easy], solutions.

I like open source.

Besides programming, I am also interested in international development
and economics.

In my free time I read books, play football, and spend time with my
friends.

And most importantly I attempt to live out my faith in Jesus Christ.
