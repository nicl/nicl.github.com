About me in general
-------------------

I am from the UK but have also lived abroad - I spent 2011-2012 living and working in the beautiful city of Strasbourg, France.

I like open source and [contribute](http://drupal.org/user/427352) to [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org). For the last year I have been helping to develop Drupal and custom PHP software full-time for a  web-agency in France.

I love solving complex problems by pursuing [simple, but not necessarily easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy), solutions.

Besides programming, I am also interested in international development and economics. This has taken me from [Oxford](http://www.oxfam.org/) (as a web intern), to as far away as [South America](http://www.latinlink.org/). I'm also interested in re-using government data; I'm excited by gov.uk and the work of the (excellent) Cabinet Office IT team to create public APIs for a lot of government data.

In my free time I read books, play football, play video-games, and spend time with my friends.

And most importantly I attempt to live out my faith in Jesus Christ.

Skills
------

If programming languages were spoken then you might say I:

- am fluent in **PHP**, SQL (specifically, having used MySQL, SQLite), HTML and CSS
- can get by in **Javascript**
- know a bit of **Scala** and **Ruby**
- know a bit of noSQL databases, particularly **MongoDB**
- speak a smattering of **Clojure**, and would like to learn more about it/other languages which support a functional approach

I have particularly experience with several PHP frameworks and CMSs - most notably [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) (and the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) microframework) and [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org).

I use [git](http://github.com/nicl) everyday and also have experience working with SVN.

But, fundamentally, I consider myself a programmer; my aim is to use the right language and tools for the job, and I enjoy learning new technologies and ways of thinking in order to do this.

I am a **native-English speaker**, but also speak **French** to a reasonable level.

I studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at [university](http://www.ox.ac.uk), but decided to program for a living after making websites for friends and various events as a hobby both during and after university. I also have a masters from LSE in Development Studies (International Development - both the political side, and the economics).
