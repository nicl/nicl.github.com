title: On programmer anarchy
---

*Frustrated by your boss? Is your creativity stifled, your ideas ignored? And
what about your team: are they putting energy on the wrong things? Or perhaps
your colleagues are just difficult people, Or even simply demotivated..*

## An idea whose time has come?

Employee Anarchy is a class of organisation structures categorised by high
levels of employee freedom. This means few formal processes, no fixed roles, and
no managers. Employees self-select into teams and are free to choose what to
work on.

The idea has a seductive appeal to anyone who has been frustrated by a difficult
boss or by obstructive colleagues, which let's face it is nearly all of us at
some point or another. For with 'anarchy' comes *freedom* - and it is human nature
to long to be free. Anarchy means not having to ask permission, no one to get in
the way, no boredom, no slog, passion unhindered, running wind in the hair!

...well, no, now we are in fantasy land.

But is the core idea itself workable? Or is it idealistic, naive even?

One suspicion is that poor performers blame managers for their own failings and
lack of initiative. After all, good employees *make* things happen, right, even
through adverse circumstances.

And the best employees go further and actually *change* their circumstances.

Most of us, however, are not exceptional. The best can often overcome, or
change, circumstances through great leadership and persistence, but most
employees are, by definition, average.<a href="#average-is-average">\*</a>

In any case, good business owners and leaders should constantly review their
company structure; people can and do succeed in traditional hierarchies, but the
question is: can a different structure yield better results?

## Case studies and publication bias

What about real life examples then?

Unfortunately, as an idea, employee anarchy is relatively untried. I'm not aware
of any large-sample statistical analyses comparing the employee-led model with
more traditional ones. And, in any case, the statistical hurdles to overcome in
order to make such a study sensible would be high indeed.<a
href="#bad-statistics">\*\*</a>

Instead, then, we're left with case studies. And for 'case studies' read PR-like
blog posts describing 'success' cases. Below we'll discuss some of these
examples and then pull out some common themes.

So not exactly science, but nonetheless some very interesting food for thought.

Let's get to the examples...

### The Mail Online

[http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/how-node-js-has-revolutionized-the-mailonline](http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/how-node-js-has-revolutionized-the-mailonline)

[The Mail Online][] is a trashy, celebrity-filled 'news' website. It is, in
fact, the most read English-language newspaper in the world. Wikipedia tells me
they reached 105.72 million unique web browsers in August 2012, and the number
has almost certainly improved since then.

In short, we must grudgingly admit that they are very successful at what they
do.

Perhaps surprisingly, they are a keen advocate of Employee Anarchy.

The piece linked above is mostly a PR exercise about their use of a specific
technology - Node JS. However, also discussed is their adoption of 'Developer
Driven Development' (their version of no managers), a change driven by their
at-the-time Chief Architect Fred George. DDD is described as the following
practices:

> The Rules are simple: developers, on a 'Table' (team), own a project
> end-to-end and have the freedom to make their own choices. All major work is a
> team backlog that can be picked up by a Table. People can move freely among
> Tables (they can also be kicked out, and apply to move to other tables). Most
> Tables have 2-6 people on them. Tables have end-to-end responsibilities,
> including fixing it if it breaks at 3am. Tables choose whatever process works
> for them.

And, in addition:

> ..no unnecessary roles exist that separate developers from the customer, no
> unnecessary processes should be employed as a crutch (against fear)..

The article itself doesn't really discuss the impact of this organisational
change (although the implicit suggestion is that it was a
positive). Fortunately, however, Fred George has recently
[presented on this topic][Fred George Slideshare].

There are several cited benefits, so I'll just pick out a few here. Firstly, a
lack of managers enables different decisions to be made. For example, he cites
an app being re-written multiple times - a decision he thinks most managers
would be unlikely to make. Another benefit is that developers are liberated to
adopt a broader range of technologies. This leads to better products and more
motivated workers. Lastly, a lack of managers focuses an organisation on
(presumably measurable) success metrics in order to better hold teams to
account.

Unlike most of the examples below, we do get some discussion of the negatives
and unknowns. 'Anarchy' in practice, says George, is very much a function of
team composition, and sometimes you still need top-down guidance. Lastly, he
acknowledges that their experiences haven't yet been stressed in the crucible of
financial difficulty.

We'll consider some of these later. For now, let's move on to the next case
study.

### Treehouse

[http://ryancarson.com/post/61562761297/no-managers-why-we-removed-bosses-at-treehouse](http://ryancarson.com/post/61562761297/no-managers-why-we-removed-bosses-at-treehouse)

[Treehouse][] is an online e-learning platform, which teaches people how to
code. They moved to a managerless structure after an employee vote.

Reading the article, the Treehouse move appears to have been motivated by a
concern that managers, rather than facilitating change, were acting to block
it. Not necessarily deliberately, but somehow this was happening.

Worth noting here is the underlying belief that people 'want to be amazing at
their job' but often feel powerless to implement their ideas. Over time this
leads to an 'indifferent cynicism' which impacts their work.

This highly positive view of employees and people in general is a common theme
among anarchy-advocates.

By the way, if you've ever wondered about the specifics of how 'anarchy' can be
organised (which is a strange way of putting it) then the Treehouse article is
well worth a read - it goes into a lot of detail on how they've worked it all
out.

### Github

[http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style](http://tomayko.com/writings/management-style)

[Github][] is a software-as-a-service company, providing code hosting and
workflow tools. The site has over 5m users including many corporate clients such
as The Guardian (where I work).

Github is financially very successful and has been profitable almost since
inception. They practice a flat hierarchy - no managers - and have an 'open
allocation' system - people work on projects that interest them. And, again from
Wikipedia (yes, I have donated), it is worth noting that salaries are set by the
Chief Exec, Tom Preston-Werner. At the moment time of writing, Github has
precisely 234 employees according to their website.

Github's Director of Engineering, Ryan Tomayko, has written an interesting blog
about his role and the benefits of a managerless culture. He cites two
particular benefits of not managing people. Firstly, managers don't scale, by
which he means that as a business grows they can become blockers or get
over-stretched and, by implication, make bad decisions. The second point is
simply that 'telling people what to do is lazy'; it's better to 'convince...by
argument'. Consensus, or at least vigorous debate, Tomayko argues, leads to
better results.

### Valve

[http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/valve-how-i-got-here-what-its-like-and-what-im-doing-2/](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/valve-how-i-got-here-what-its-like-and-what-im-doing-2/)

[Valve][] is one of the most successful video-game and digital distribution
companies in the world. Their online [Steam][] service has over 65 million
users. The company is privately held and does not disclose financial data, but a
[Forbes article][Forbes on Valve] from 2011 conservatively estimates their value
as between $2-4 billion. The number has likely risen substantially since
then. On a per-employee basis it has been suggested Valve makes more profit then
both Apple and Google. Numbers-wise, the company has somewhere around 300
employees.

Valve practice have practiced employee anarchy from the start. In a nice detail,
employees desks are on wheels so they can easily switch teams and workplaces. As with all of our examples, trust plays a huge
role in how Valve operates; even their most successful and long-term projects
such as Steam have no formal management structure.

The picture that emerges from Michael Abrash's blog is, to borrow his own
phrase, one of evolution, a messy state of affairs but one which is incredibly
dynamic. Sometimes people 'wander down paths which are clearly not working'
(things fail) but the overall picture is one of success.

### Morning Star

[https://archive.harvardbusiness.org/cla/web/pl/product.seam?c=573&i=15715&cs=7c855bfce2fd1c3860846954978b1181 (pdf)](https://archive.harvardbusiness.org/cla/web/pl/product.seam?c=573&i=15715&cs=7c855bfce2fd1c3860846954978b1181)

[Morning Star][] is a food processor company in the states. As an example of
managerless structures they are particularly interesting because they are *not*
a tech company. In fact, what they do (mostly processing tomatoes it seems) is
relatively mundane. Yet their structure is quite extraordinary - no managers, no
titles and no promotions, compensation determined by peers, and so on.

## Summary of benefits:

Collecting together the examples above, all argue that decentralised
decision-making yields better results. Potential reasons for this are described
below.

### Employees are more motivated (and achieve more)

People are more motivated if they can work on what they want to. Going
managerless, it is argued, substantially reduces the friction an employee
experiences in pursuing their ideas. This liberates employees to be
creative. Conversely, Treehouse and others suggest a more hierarchical model
stifles creativity.

Employees are also often not boxed into a specific role. In Morning Star, for
example, roles are not defined. People can shift what they are doing and rapidly
take on more responsibility if able. Official roles can slow things down.

Lastly, Morning Star have better-than-average employee retention; more motivated
employees stick around.

### Employees are more focused on company goals

A lack of managers forces companies to identify and communicate goals to all
employees. As Morning Star express it 'the mission is the boss'.

### No single point of failure (employees make decisions collectively)

No one can dictate; you have to persuade your colleagues something is
worthwhile.

### Employees take more risks

An emphasis on smaller teams which are empowered to take risks. This means more
ideas are tried (and failed), which translates into faster learning and
subsequent success.

### New possibilities in decision-making

Both Fred George from The Mail Online and Michael Abrash from Valve argue that
employee anarchy enables a new kind of decision-making. Alternatively put,
certain decisions that managers tend not to make are made by employees under
employee anarchy.

The reasons for this are unclear. Perhaps the suggestion is that managers tend
to be more conservative. Or perhaps it's that employees are simply more wacky.

## Improved communication between employees

Managers often filter communication between different teams and departments -
indeed it is often argued that managers should act as a buffer in this way. But
several of the companies listed above argue that removing middle-layers
(managers and other roles) improved communication.

### Better employee development and training

Employees it is argued tend to know what they need to develop. Managerless
companies often are far more relaxed when it comes to discretionary spending (on
training, or other resources) than hierarchical companies. Within the tech
world, at The Mail and elsewhere, we see managerless teams being much bolder in
their technical choices. This promotes learning.

## Questions and criticisms:

### Do you need super employees and existing financial success to make it work?

None of the cited companies are really really large. Perhaps the model works
best with smaller companies who only hire the best employees?

### Sample bias

Is it limited to certain industries/markets? Where are the failure cases (they
must exist, but the web suffers from [publication bias][Publication bias] just
as much as journals do).

### Do we really need to go managerless to achieve the supposed benefits of employee-anarchy?

Managers that curtail the creativity of their colleagues do not sound like
particularly good managers. Can we not simply improve our hiring and training of
managers rather than abolishing them altogether? If the concern is around a lack
of risk-taking, there are lots of to liberate decision-making - smaller teams,
shorter product cycles, celebrating failure (where learning has taken place),
and so on.

### What about office politics?

Does a managerless culture become cliquey? See for example
[a more negative description of life at Valve][Bad Valve].

### What about pay and promotion?

Who decides what people should earn, and when to pay people more or less than
before?

And what about free-riders - how does discipline work without managers?

In practice, the companies above take varying approaches. Peer-based
compensation is common (Valve, Morning Star), but others set pay-awards from the
top (Github, Treehouse).

It feels like pay and structure are related, but it's not entirely clear how the
one constrains the other.

## Some closing thoughts

This article is neither scientific nor even balanced. It's meant to
provoke. Most people are not even aware of alternatives to a manager-based
hierarchy at work. When I mention the idea of employee-anarchy to friends or
colleagues the typical reaction is of incredulity. But the companies above show
that a looser structure can work and even yield incredible success.

Does this mean we should all suddenly switch to employee anarchy? Not at all!
But there are many reasons to be attracted to the idea of giving employees
greater freedom at work. Whether we are owners or employees, we should be bolder
in our conception and practice of work.

<a name="average-is-average">\*</a> Let's not quibble about whether this is statistically correct. If you're of a pedantic mind, just assume I meant the median average here.

<a name="bad-statistics">\*\*</a> This is an understatement.
