Code Foo is a summer internship scheme run by IGN, working in their San Francisco office. To quote from their website:

*Code-Foo is a six-week program where you'll get paid to learn cutting-edge tech and have the opportunity to work on real IGN engineering projects. While you're here you'll be trained by today's industry leaders in a conference-style setting. Next, you'll have time dedicated to work in small teams on real projects.*
