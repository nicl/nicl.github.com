title: San Francisco, part 1
---

It's 5.38pm on my first full day in San Francisco. After a ~16 journey\*, via New York,
I arrived in San Francisco airport around 9.30 last night. I took the BART
(local train system) to my accommodation and managed to say hi to a few Code
Fooers who were up and about before heading to bed around midnight. Didn't sleep
at all because of jet-lag, but am feeling pretty tired now so will hopefully
sleep better tonight(!).

Today I had a wander around town in the morning and grabbed breakfast with
another Code Fooer, and then did some shopping and more wandering - to [Golden
Gate Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Park,_San_Francisco).

In the light of day San Francisco is a beautiful (though in quite an urban
American way) and sunny city. It feels part familiar, because I have seen so
many US TV shows and films, but also part alien as I try and mesh my
preconceptions with the reality.

Some highlights:

* the trams!
* the weather
* the sea
* the shops
* [Whole Foods](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/) (the most incredible lunch salad bars, and general foodery place I
have ever seen - think this will because a regular food stop)
* other Code Fooers

Not so goods:

* lots of homeless people

We start at IGN tomorrow. I'm feeling nervous but excited at the same time. I'm looking
forward to learning new things and working with some great people. Here goes...

\* Nic's onboard film reviews:

* Hunger Games (8/10 - I'd already watched this, but it is worth a repeat)
* Wrath of the Titans (4/10 - no meaningful plot or characters, just decent but
forgetable CGI action scenes and a lot of thespian-talent gone to waste)
