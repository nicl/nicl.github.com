I did not much think about Bangladesh before arriving and, I suppose,
neither did I think much of it either, but experience is
formative.

Two weeks and I cannot help but be changed; Bangladesh is a wonderful
country.

## Dhaka

[Dhaka][dhaka] is Bangladesh's largest city, the capital. It is hot,
intensely crowded, loud, full of traffic, full of what we shall call
arresting odours, full, in fact, of people.

This is where my trip started. I arrived at Shahjalal Airport at 4:50am,
tired by eager-eyed to experience Bangladesh and catch up with some
good friends.

The first few days were spent exploring the city. Dhaka is a large (12
million people) city, in the middle of the country. Lots of people,
lots of noise, very hot, a real attack on the senses. There isn't
really too much to see in terms of tourist sites; the city itself is
the spectacle.

Walking aimlessly in Old Dhaka is recommended, as
it taking food somewhere local and cheap - mutton biryani is the
classic choice here.

Food connoisseurs will be pleasantly surprised by the range of
international cuisine available in the wealthier parts of town. We ate
practically every kind of cuisine whilst there. The Holey Bakery,
providing excellent French bread and pastries, is especially popular
with the expat community.

For a different kind of eating experience, I recommend the Pyongyang
Restaurant. There young, invariably attractive, female waitresses will
give a musical performance (singing and dancing) later on in the
evening. Audience partipation is also mandatory; being dragged up to
sing karaoke proved an awkward but also hilarious moment for me. I'd
love to interview the staff to find out more about their
lives. Unfortunately, the likelihood of them feeling able to give open
answers is low to zero - the restaurant is essentially a propaganda
machine for the North Korean embassy, which is located nearby.

To get around Dhaka you need to take a rickshaw for shorter journeys,
or a CNG (an auto rickshaw, essentially a three-wheeled moped) for
longer ones. In either case, journeys place you in the middle of the
wacky-races. Anything goes if it can get you to your destination that
little bit faster. And as in the cartoon, different vehicles display
different characteristics: rickshaws score high for manoevrability but
low on speed, cars are fast but less nimble, and CNGs, quite often
literally, found somewhere between the two.

However you travel, traffic is a constant friend.

## Srimangal (the North)

After the first few hectic days in Dhaka, we flew north. Srimangal, a
division of the province of Sylhet, is quite different from Dhaka. It
is rural, green, quiet, and peaceful.

## A boat trip down south

For my last few days I wanted to get out of Dhaka again. I'd heard the
old paddle-steamers were still running South and decided to take one
overnight to a lesser-known town called Burishal, spend the day there,
and then come back overnight again. Typically people stay on the boat
all the way down to the [Sundarbarns][sundarbarns], a vast mangrove
forest and home to the famous Bengal Tiger, but you need to book trips
far in advance and, in any case, I was short on time.



## On poverty



Bangladesh is a country brimming with life: a land full of water, and
full of people too.

I have never been anywhere like Bangladesh.
