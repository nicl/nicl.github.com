I have been a professional software developer (and also at points people
manager, tech lead and ninja - the last is a joke) for the last 7 and a
half years.

Despite bad management (on my part and others) and bad software
development, somehow, things have got delivered. I have helped build the
core content API for the Guardian, built lots of small PHP-based
websites, migrated stuff to the cloud, developed moderation tools, built
an various APIs, and plenty more besides. At the moment, I'm leading on
a re-architecture of https://www.theguardian.com.

I've worked with some really great people who I am grateful to.

But this blog post is about _mistakes_, of which there have been plenty.
People don't like to talk about making a mess of things - it's a form of
publication bias I suppose.

So here is my list of failures and lessons learnt. It's not a
comprehensive list, partly because my failures are legion, but also
because somethings are difficult to discuss without being criticla of
others, and that's not my aim here.

Nonetheless, I hope these anecdotes are educational.

## The gigantic rewrite

My first project at the Guardian as a green, barely literate programmer.
(Despite these undeniable facts, I did not lack confidence in my
technical decision-making - go figure.)

## The SPA

## The over-engineered API
