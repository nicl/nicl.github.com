To those who are leaving Strasbourg for the summer or more permanently here is Paul's goodbye to the Galatians, which I hope you will take to heart:

*Good-bye, friends. Love mixed with faith be yours from God the Father and from the Master, Jesus Christ.*

*Pure grace and nothing but grace be with all who love our Master, Jesus Christ.*

*Amen(!)*

(We're going to miss you!)
