# Why did Jesus have to die?

We know from Romans (Abraham) that justification is *always* by
faith. Our nature is sinful, because of Adam, but God accepts our
imperfect offering. 'Faith' happens when we stop trying to do things
our own way and look to God instead for our needs.

And God promises Abraham that he will *bless* his descendants.

[Give quote.]

So what about Jesus?

Jesus said to God, 'All the anger you have at their sin, *put on me*.

So God raised him up and gave him the name Higher Than All.
