Easter 2020 - How to deal with regrets?

If we are stuck in regret, like me, hear the words of Isaiah spoken
over you:

> Forget the former things; do not dwell in the past.

> See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive
> it?

> I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.

(Isaiah 42.)

There is *always* hope for the future in Jesus. He is *always*
enough. So many of us live half-lives, and I have certainly lived this
at times these past few years., but His offer is life in all fullness.

We are not called to dwell on our former sins. Repent, yes. But
repentance means to *turn*; we are not to spend our efforts looking
back, wondering what could have been.

For broken relationships, regret risks making an idol of the person we
have lost, however wonderful they were, or may still be.

Wth God there is always hope for healing of of course, especially if
both sides know Jesus, but even healing does not mean things going
back to what they were. Our bad decisions have real, human,
consequences. This is why Jesus takes sin so seriously.

To understand sin's full weight, we look to the cross. The life of one
innocent, perfect, sweet, saviour, for your selfishness and for mine.

The cost was always too high.
