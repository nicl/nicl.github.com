If you are stuck in the wasteland of regret, hear the words of Isaiah
this Easter:

> Forget the former things; do not dwell in the past.

> See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive
> it?

> I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.

There is *always* hope for the future in Jesus. He is *always*
enough. So many of us live half-lives, and I have certainly lived this
at times these past few years, but His offer is life in all
fullness. And I can testify to that too.

Yet we know the cost of sin. we see it at the cross. The life of one
innocent, perfect, sweet, saviour, for your selfishness and for mine.

The cost was always too high.

Jesus, thank you for Easter.
