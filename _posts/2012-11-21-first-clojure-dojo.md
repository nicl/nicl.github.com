title: First Clojure Dojo with the London Clojurians
---

A while back I bought the book [Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)
written by Bruce Tate. The book offers a (very) brief introduction to
seven languages; collectively, the languages were selected so as to
represent a diverse range of programming styles, but the book has a
particular leaning towards functional programming.

Of the seven languages, the one that stood out the most for me was
Clojure - a functional, dynamic programming language, hosted on (and
fully seeking to exploit) the JVM. Clojure is also, it is important to
note, a dialectic of Lisp.

In the last few weeks I have begun to play around with Clojure. Last
Monday (the 19th of November) I went along to my first Clojure Dojo -
a learning and social event run each month by the London Clojurians
(a community of Clojure developers in London).

As part of a team of four, I worked on implementing an evaluator for
the original lisp in Clojure. We didn't quite finish in the
hour-and-a-half or so available, but we got pretty close. I learnt a
lot and had a great time.

In short, I went to my first London Clojure Dojo and it won't be my
last!

Thanks to [Bruce Durling](https://twitter.com/otfrom) for
running the event and [Forward](http://www.forward.co.uk/) for
hosting.
