title: IGN Code Foo!
---

I found out today that I have been accepted for IGN's Code Foo 2012! This is going to be awesome!

Code Foo is a summer internship scheme run by IGN. To quote from their website:

*Code-Foo is a six-week program where you'll get paid to learn cutting-edge tech and have the opportunity to work on real IGN engineering projects. While you're here you'll be trained by today's industry leaders in a conference-style setting. Next, you'll have time dedicated to work in small teams on real projects.*

The sad news is that I have to leave Strasbourg and all my friends :( for at least a little while. But the chance of working and learning at IGN was too good to pass up!

I'll be blogging on my Code Foo experiences regularly once I get to San Francisco. In the meantime, for anyone interested, you can read up on Code Foo [here](http://code.ign.com/foo). And if you're interested in my application, check out [my github repo](http://github.com/nic/ign).
